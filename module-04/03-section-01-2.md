# Section II - executable

> sourcing.rs

We first need to create the executable file: `src/bin/tdg-analyzer.rs`.

We start by declaring our dependent external crates

```rust
extern crate kafka;
extern crate clap;
```

We then declare the modules we will be using.

```rust

```

Finally, we write the main function that will be called.

```rust

```

When you are finished, the `tdg-analyzer.rs` file should look like this:

```rust

```
