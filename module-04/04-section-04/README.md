# Section IV - executable

> [Cargo.toml](https://github.com/dsietz/daas-workshop/blob/master/rust-daas/Cargo.toml)

> daas-sourcing.rs

We are now ready to write the executable. To do this, we will working with the following files:

* `Cargo.toml` \(manifest\)
* `web-service-tests.rs` \(service tests\)
* `src/bin/daas-sourcing.rs` \(executable\) 

> Try to rerun the `cargo test` command, and ensure that all the test pass.
