# Module III - Building a Data Sample Analyzer

In this module we will create a microservice that will listen to a topic on the Kafka broker, analyze the data, and add it o the profile. We will make this a configurable mircoservice, so that we can spin up multiple instances based on the Kafka topic \(`data topic`\) they need to analyze.
