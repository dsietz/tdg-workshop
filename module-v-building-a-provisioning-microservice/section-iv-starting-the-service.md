# Section IV - starting the service

Before we modify the service to perform our desired business logic, \(to aggregate the clothing orders\) we first want to check that the service is consuming the DaaSDcouments and extracting the data correctly.

Since this is a microservice that runs in the background, we will start the service using the `.target/debug/` executable that is created by the `cargo build` command.

```text
ArchConfWorkshopUser:~/environment/rust-daas (master) $ cargo build
   Compiling rust-daas v0.1.0 (/home/ec2-user/environment/rust-daas)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 26.11s
```

> NOTE: Make sure the all you dependent services are still runing: Zookeeper, Kafka, sorucing, and myapp\_genesis

In a new terminal, run the following command:

```text
./rust-daas/target/debug/myapp_order_clothing
```

```text
ArchConfWorkshopUser:~/environment/rust-daas (master) $ ./rust-dass/target/debug/myapp_order_clothing
