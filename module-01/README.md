# Module I - Overview of the DaaS Pattern

Data as a Service is an agile architecture pattern that allows real-time data provisioning, adherence to the principles of the **last responsible moment \(LRM\)**, and facilitates the delivery of the **Minimal Viable Product \(MVP\)**.

> Last Responsible Moment \(LRM\): A strategy of not making a premature decision but instead delaying commitment and keeping important and irreversible decisions open until the cost of not making a decision becomes greater than the cost of making a decision.
