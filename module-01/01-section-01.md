# Section I - Overview

The availability of Test Data remains to be a difficult challenge for any testing framework - manual or automated. In order to be effective test data, it must be:

* Realistic
* Timely
* Subsets
* Repeatable

### Realistic

In order for the Test Data to be realistic, it must effectively represent the **variety**, **size** and **complexity** of the original data. It must be a accurate profile of the data you wish to mimic.

### Timely

Untimely Test Data can directly impact our ability to test our solutions and hinder our devlier time. Waiting for Test Data to be _reset_ after running tests, \(e.g.: scheduled batch jobs\) is a common point of frustration.

### Subsets
