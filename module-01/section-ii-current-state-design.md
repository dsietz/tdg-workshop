# Section II - Current State Design

Most testing frameworks have not moved beyond the traditional monolithic pattern and data batching.

### Effectiveness

Traditional testing frameworks are far from timely. The process for adding new test data from an original source, \(e.g.: production data\) is complex and a lengthy process. Tight coupling between the original data source, \(e.g.: relational data model\) and test definitions, \(e.g.: scheme-less documents\) becomes an ever lasting exercise in data mapping complexity.

### Security

In order to be compliant with security and data privacy rules, the extraction, cleansing, and landing of production data as it feeds the test data becomes a point of contention. 

### Privacy by Design

Privacy by Design is the practice of embedding privacy into the design and operation of technical and business solutions and processes. Because traditional testing platforms were not designed from the ground up with data privacy in mind, they become a common focal point for breeches in data privacy.
